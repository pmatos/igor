# Igor

Chrome side panel for Element Web: a chat with a local Ollama model that sees the room you have open.

## Installation

Requirements: Chrome (or a Chromium browser with side panel support), [Ollama](https://ollama.com) running locally with at least one model pulled, and an Element Web account. No build step or dependencies.

1. Get the code:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pmatos/igor.git
   ```
2. Pull a model if you have none, for example `ollama pull gemma4:12b`. Pick one that supports tools if you want web search; others fall back to plain chat.
3. Let Ollama accept requests from the extension, otherwise it answers 403. Set `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=chrome-extension://*` and restart it:
   - systemd user service: `systemctl --user edit ollama`, add `[Service]` and `Environment=OLLAMA_ORIGINS=chrome-extension://*`, then `systemctl --user restart ollama`
   - manual: `OLLAMA_ORIGINS='chrome-extension://*' ollama serve`
4. Load the extension: open `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**, click **Load unpacked** and select the cloned `igor` directory. Command-line flags like `--load-extension` are ignored by recent branded Chrome, so use this UI.
5. Open Element Web in a tab and click the Igor toolbar icon. The panel docks beside the page. Choose a model in the dropdown; the room you have open is picked up automatically.

Updating: `git pull`, then click the reload icon on the Igor card in `chrome://extensions`.

Ollama is expected at `http://localhost:11434`; change it under **Settings** in the panel. The extension requests `https://*/*` host access so it works on any Element host and `fetch_url` can read pages; narrow `host_permissions` in `manifest.json` if you only use one host.

First questions in a long room can be slow on modest hardware because the whole context is processed. Lower **Max room messages** in Settings, or use a smaller or MoE model.

## Usage

- **Room context** checkbox: include recent messages of the open room in each question.
- **Web tools** checkbox: let the model search the web, fetch pages and read older room history.
- **Message links**: answers cite room messages as `#12` links with a hover tooltip (sender, time). Clicking one jumps the Element tab to that message, so you can ask for a summary and read the parts that matter.
- **Clear** resets the conversation; switching rooms keeps the chat but the next question uses the new room.

## How it works

- Room context comes from Element's own `window.mxMatrixClientPeg` (matrix-js-sdk client), read via a `world: "MAIN"` script injected on each send. Decrypted events work; no second Matrix login. This is an internal global and may change between Element versions.
- The room is taken from the URL hash (`#/room/...`). Older history is back-paginated up to "Max room messages".
- Model list comes from `GET /api/tags`; chat uses `/api/chat` with streaming, `think: false` and an explicit `num_ctx`.

## Tools

The model can call (toggle "Web tools" in the panel; models without tool support fall back automatically):

- `web_search` — Brave Search HTML results, no API key (DuckDuckGo blocks extension requests)
- `fetch_url` — page text, truncated to 8k chars
- `get_older_messages` — back-paginates the room via the Matrix client for history beyond the initial window

The extension requests `https://*/*` host access so `fetch_url` and Element on any host work.

## Layout

- `src/panel.*` — side panel UI
- `src/extract.js` — room extraction (injected into the page)
- `src/background.js` — opens the panel on icon click
